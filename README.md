# TicketMS
TicketMS is a Ticket Management System concept that automatically outputs all ticket work notes into a one-time disposition. 

Purpose: Ticket Management Systems are inefficient, requiring multiple dispositions that often use multiple, incompatible platforms. This repository serves to create a resource of tools (wiki/links) as well as software that automatically outputs/scripts form data from CMS to a separate disposition tool, which could be portable.
